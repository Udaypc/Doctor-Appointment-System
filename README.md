## 🧩 Microservices Used

- **API Gateway Service**
  - Routes requests to respective services
  - Handles authentication and authorization

- **Auth Service**
  - OAuth2 authentication
  - Token generation and validation

- **Patient Service**
  - Patient registration
  - Appointment booking
  - Profile management

- **Doctor Service**
  - Doctor data
  - Appointment handling

- **Eureka Server**
  - Service registry and discovery

---

## 🔐 Security Flow

1. User logs in using OAuth2.
2. Token is generated by Auth Service.
3. Client sends token with each request.
4. API Gateway validates token.
5. Request is routed to appropriate microservice.

---

## 🗂 AWS S3 Integration

- Used to upload and store user profile images.
- Only image URLs are stored in MySQL.
- Provides scalable and secure file storage.

---

## 🔄 Inter-Service Communication

- Implemented using **Feign Client**
- Allows one microservice to call another easily
- Load balanced using Eureka

---

## 🗃 Database

- MySQL is used for storing:
  - Users
  - Doctors
  - Appointments
  - Profile image URLs
